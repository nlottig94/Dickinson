Publication History
Scribner's Magazine, 8 (August 1890), 240, without stanza 4, from the copy to Susan Dickinson ([E]).  Lavinia Dickinson protested this publication, and Mabel Todd pointed out that "sail" in line 7 was a misreading for "soul" (Bingham, AB, 59, 149n). With the permission of Scribner's the poem was included in Poems (1890), 58-59, but the text itself derived from the fascicle (C), with the first word of the last line concluding the penultimate one; all the alternatives had been adopted (in accord with ed's revisions), "revelations" adopted as the revision for line 4, and stanza 4 restored. Although a facsimile of the retained copy (B) was included in Poems (1891) to verify the correctness of "soul" in line 7, the text in CP (1924), 152-53, reverted to "sail," based upon the annotation in Susan's copy of Poems (1890). Poems (1955), 249-53 (A, B as lost, C, D principal, [E] conjectured); CP (1960), 152-53 (D). Letters (1958), 390 (A). MB (1981), 275-77 (C), in facsimile.  (J322). Franklin Variorum 1998 (F325D).
