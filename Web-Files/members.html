The interdisciplinary nature of Digital Humanities is at the core of her undergraduate and graduate work. The combination of history, psychology, and sociology as part of her Social Sciences undergraduate major contributed to my interest in developing digital projects that serve marginalized populations. She looks forward to further developing her skills in digital curation, spatial humanities, natural language processing, and collaborative digital pedagogy through the courses and mentorship available to her as a Digital Humanities Master's student at Loyola University Chicago among a strong community of Chicago-land Digital Humanists. She is highly interested in open access digital methods and the community advocacy of digital accessibility. She is most experienced with digital pedagogy, Git/GitHub version control and social coding, XML encoding and processing (using XSLT and XQuery as well as schema writing), and digital humanities project management.</p>
