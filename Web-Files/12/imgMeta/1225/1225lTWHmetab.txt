Publication History
Higginson, Christian Union, 42 (25 September 1890), 393, in part, as two eight-line stanzas, from his copy (B) but with readings from the fascicle (A).  Poems (1890), 96-97, in part, from the fascicle (A), as five stanzas of 4, 4, 4, 4, and 5 lines; the alternative for line 8 was adopted. CP (1924), 122, with "comb" substituted for "brush" in line 6, from Susan's annotation deriving in turn from the text sent to her. In Poems (1930), 104-5, the text sent to Susan (D), arranged as six quatrains and a concluding stanza of five lines, replaced the one that had descended from Poems (1890); a note explained that three omitted stanzas were thus restored. Poems (1955), 245-49 (A, B principal, C); CP (1960), 151-52 (B). MB (1981), 253-55 (A), in facsimile. (J321). Franklin Variorum 1998 (F334B).
