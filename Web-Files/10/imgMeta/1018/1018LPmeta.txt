Publication History
Springfield Daily Republican (1 March 1862), 2, apparently from the lost copy to Susan Dickinson ([A]). Higginson, Christian Union, 42 (25 September 1890), 393, the complete poem from the early version in Fascicle 6 (B) and, separately, the second stanza of the later version that had been sent to him (F). Higginson explained that the separate stanza struck "a note too fine to be lost." Poems (1890), 113, combined these elements, arranged as three quatrains, with the early fascicle version (B) as stanzas 1 and 2 and the second stanza of the later version, apparently from Higginson's copy (F), as stanza 3. A facsimile of Higginson's copy was printed in Higginson and Boynton, A Reader's History of American Literature (1903), 130-31. LL (1924), 78, the second stanza of the second version to Susan (C) and the third version of the stanza to her (D). Bingham, AB (1945), 383n, the first alternative version for the second stanza, as a quatrain, from Fascicle 10 (E).
