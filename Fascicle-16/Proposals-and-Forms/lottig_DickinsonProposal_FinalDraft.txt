[Emily Dickinson: Fascicle 16](http://dickinson16.newtfire.org/) is a repurposed version of two previous websites that explore the poems in Dickinson's Fascicle 16. The original websites look at variants within the poems that Dickinson herself had made. Our group compared the changes that were made to the poems in a selected list of published versions from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We worked together in our Fall 2015 [DH class](http://newtfire.org/dh/CDASyll.html) at [Pitt-Greensburg](http://www.greensburg.pitt.edu/) to completely refurbish the existing work and display our own findings.
We worked with photo-facsimiles of Dickinson's manuscripts to fix any transcription errors and mark-up the poems' original variations using [TEI XML coding](https://github.com/ebeshero/EmilyDickinson16/blob/master/Dickinson/1601variant.xml), and we added the variations found in the published versions. Next, we created a complicated [XSLT](https://github.com/ebeshero/EmilyDickinson16/blob/master/Dickinson/dickinson.xsl) to transform our XML into HTML. Using [CSS](https://github.com/ebeshero/EmilyDickinson16/blob/master/Web%20Files/css/styles.css) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/ebeshero/EmilyDickinson16/blob/master/Web%20Files/scripts/dickinson.js) we were able to display the [variations between the manuscript transcriptions](http://dickinson16.newtfire.org/1601.html) and the published versions and project a visually pleasing website. In order to show where the variations were located and compare the manuscripts to the published versions of the poems, we utilized Photoshop and [image-mapping](https://github.com/ebeshero/EmilyDickinson16/blob/master/Web%20Files/1601.html) over all of the poems' images. Finally, we produced an [SVG graph](http://dickinson16.newtfire.org/dash.html) to represent the percentage of dash reduction in the published versions compared to the manuscripts.
Our studies found that the published versions changed the original poems considerably. We particularly focused on the dashes that were removed by later editors. These changes are significant because the dashes sometimes create a caesura, and the lack of or addition of them in the published versions alter how the poems are read and understood. This knowledge will help facilitate other scholars' literary research about Emily Dickinson's Fascicle 16. Future development of this project will include analyzing other changes between the manuscripts and published versions of the poems, such as capitalization, punctuation, and word choice.
