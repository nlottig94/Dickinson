        <p>During her lifetime, Emily Dickinson wrote poems that were bundled together as a cluster of pages called a fascicle. These bundles of pages were not found
        until after her death by her sister Lavinia who had been willed all of Emily Dickinson's earthly possesions. In total, there were 40 different booklets of more than
        800 poems. These poems were then published in print and edited up to the editors' discretion. These published versions were often changed from Dickinson's originals.
        For more information about these publications, visit the <a href="https://www.emilydickinsonmuseum.org/posthumous_publication">Emily Dickinson Museum site</a>.</p>
        
        
        <p>Our site repurposes two previous sites and serves to look at Fascicle 16.
        Dickinson's original version of the poems are placed side by side with the published versions to compare these differences. To view poems, select the Poem tab and choose
        a poem to look at. You can then decide which version of the poem you would like to look at and can click more than one publication or the original Fascicle 16 version to view
        the line changes side by side. For more information, please view our
        About page for more about the story of this project and our Conclusion page for more about the questions posed by the project.</p>
